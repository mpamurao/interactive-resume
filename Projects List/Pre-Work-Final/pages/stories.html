        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is watching anime. The first show I remember 
        watching was <i>Pokemon</i>. I followed the series from the beginning when 
        the main character Ash received Pikachu, his first Pokemon. As the world 
        continued to expand with new Pokemon and evolutions, I eventually stopped 
        watching after the season with "Battle Frontier". My first video game was 
        also <i>Pokemon</i>, specifically <i>Fire Red</i> and <i>Leaf Green</i> 
        for the Gameboy Advance SP.</p>

            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBmgAp_PlgI" frameborder="0" 
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; 
            gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
        </div>

        <p>I thought the adventures in the <i>Pokemon</i> world were exciting and 
        contained meaningful relationships and memories that Ash made along his 
        journey. My love for <i>Pokemon</i> as a kid eventually led me to watching 
        other anime and playing more video games.</p>

        <p>Ironically, my favorite show isn't <i>Pokemon</i>. It's <i>Clannad</i>.
