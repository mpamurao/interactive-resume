        <p><span>N</span>ice to meet you. My name is Marie Amurao. Born in the Philippines,
            and raised in a small town in South Carolina, I grew up with a passion to 
            see the world. I have an interest in learning about cultures, 
            from their history filled with traditions to how they've evolved into what 
            we see today. But what I find most interesting to think about is,
            How will life change for tomorrow?</p>
        <p>With the invention of new technology reaching more people and influencing 
            our lifestyles at a fast rate, will we still remember how the world was for 
            the generations before us, or when we were kids? Or are we eagerly 
            anticipating what life can be in virtual reality?</p>
        <p>I'm beginning my programming journey, and this page is my starting point.
            One day, I'd like to look back here and think, "This was me before.
            And here I am now. I have the skills to work with and create software.
            This is how much I've grown."</p>
